I used UI libraries where necessary. 

## Future Developments

Due to time limit, I couldn't work on customising and making the exact styling given. Such as, inputs, buttons and drop files could have been done a lot better. Hence, I like to more in that aspect. For this task, I prioritised the UX and making the functionalities work.

I also didn't have to clean up code and make it more reusable. There are so many parts that can be seperated into its own component. 

Furthermore, of course I'd like to do it more-responsive.
